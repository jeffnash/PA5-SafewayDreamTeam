Conclusion:
We are almost done.

Reason:
Below are output from my terminal

You can see that we are getting exactly the same output as reference cgen.
When it comes to checkpoint.cl (and only that), it is perfect!
except in line#700 in cool-tree.java, I have no idea how to get method index
in dispatch_table. I just know the value for IO.out_int method,
so manually typed in.. If we figure out a way, that will be the end of this checkpoint.

There is such a thing called AbstractTable.idTable. which will contain every method name.
Just saying, I have no concrete idea...

Sadly, I have no idea about the NT thing.
I agree that it will be good to know how much we have to move the stack pointer.
So far, as I implemented conditional expression, mul, plus, and eq, I have NEVER used
any $s* register except $s0, which means we can always do addiu $sp $sp -12.
I'm not sure about other expressions.


See you soon.
