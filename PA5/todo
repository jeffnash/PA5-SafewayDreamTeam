To-do list (post Thanksgiving feast):
- callee side things
	Methods to edit:
		dispatch (cool-tree) after the enumeration -- line ~704
		will need a map for matching parameter --> actual address
=> Done

- when passing an variable into a method dispatch argument instead of an integer/string/bool etc constant, we ewill need to look up the value of that attribute. this is done in _object:
	-also need to update attributes whose values are redifined in method (proably done in assignment code() method)
=> Done


======================================================================================
-I (Jaeseo) was confused about this all the time, but now it's clear:
	cool-tree's dispatch code() is code generation for <classname>.<method>(<formals>).
	It has nothing to do with method's body.
	Each methods body is covered in CgenClassTable.

-Attribute initialization. So far, we always used default value, but that's not always the case.
 Need to modify init 
 => Done


+ Assignment => Done
+ Object => Done

- isvoid
- complement
- leq, lt
- negation
- let
- case
- while
- static dispatch
- runtime error checking
- garbage collection
